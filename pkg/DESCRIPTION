Description: This package implements the algorithm in "Estimating
	     abundances of retroviral insertion sites from DNA
	     fragment length data" by Berry CC, Gillet NA, Melamed A,
	     Gormley N, Bangham CR, Bushman FD.  in Bioinformatics;
	     2012 Mar 15;28(6):755-62.  The experimental setting and
	     estimation details are described in detail
	     there. Briefly, integration of new DNA in a host genome
	     (due to retroviral infection or gene therapy) can be
	     tracked using DNA sequencing, potentially allowing
	     characterization of the abundance of individual cell
	     clones bearing distinct integration sites. The locations
	     of integration sites can be determined by fragmenting the
	     host DNA, breaking the new DNA at a known sequence,
	     amplifying the fragments containing both host and new
	     DNA, sequencing those amplicons, then mapping the host
	     sequences to positions on the reference genome. The
	     relative number of fragments containing a given position
	     in the host genome estimates the relative abundance of
	     cells hosting the corresponding integration site, but
	     that number is not available and the count of amplicons
	     per fragment varies widely.  However, the expected number
	     of distinct fragment lengths is a function of the
	     abundance of cells hosting an integration site at a given
	     position and a certain nuisance parameter. The package
	     implicitly estimates that function to estimate the
	     relative abundance.
